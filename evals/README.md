# Evaluating the nlmixr2llm skills

This directory holds a [vitals](https://vitals.tidyverse.org) evaluation of the agent and skill content. It asks one question: **does the content make a model better at nlmixr2 work?**

It is excluded from the built package (`.Rbuildignore`), so run it from a source checkout.

## Design

- **Dataset** (`dataset.R`): one row per question, with:
  - `id`, a stable sample identifier;
  - `skill`, the task skill the question exercises;
  - `input`, the prompt;
  - `target`, the grading guidance: what a correct answer must say, and the mistakes that make it wrong;
  - `runs`, whether the answer must contain executable R code.

  Targets state only facts the skills document and that were checked against the packages. Otherwise the eval measures the grader's knowledge, not the skills' effect.
- **Conditions**: the same model answers every question twice:
  - **baseline**: no system prompt;
  - **skills**: `nlmixr2llm::system_prompt(references = TRUE)`, built from the working tree, so an edited skill is evaluated without reinstalling.
- **Scoring** (`eval.R`):
  1. A grader model scores each answer C / P / I against its target (`vitals::model_graded_qa(partial_credit = TRUE)`).
  2. For `runs = TRUE` samples, the answer's fenced R code is executed in a fresh R process with nlmixr2 loaded. Code that is missing or fails lowers the grade by one level (C → P, P → I).
  3. Both outcomes are kept in each sample's `scorer_metadata`.
- **Summary**: mean score per condition and per sample, counting C = 1, P = 0.5 and I = 0. The skills' effect is the difference between the two conditions.

## Running

From the package root:

```sh
Rscript evals/eval.R
```

All settings are environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_SOLVER` | `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` | model under test, as `"provider/model"` for `ellmer::chat()` |
| `NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_GRADER` | `anthropic/claude-opus-5-5` | grading model |
| `NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_IDS` | all | comma-separated sample ids |
| `NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_EPOCHS` | `1` | repeats per sample; use 3 or more before reading anything into a difference |
| `NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_CONDITIONS` | `baseline,skills` | subset of conditions |

Any provider ellmer supports works, with its usual credentials (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...). A grader from a different model family than the solver reduces self-preference in grading. For example, grade Claude answers with Gemini:

```sh
NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_SOLVER=anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 \
NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_GRADER=google_gemini/gemini-3.5-flash \
Rscript evals/eval.R
```

A Gemini-only smoke test, two samples under both conditions:

```sh
NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_SOLVER=google_gemini/gemini-3.5-flash \
NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_GRADER=google_gemini/gemini-3.5-flash \
NLMIXR2LLM_EVAL_IDS=sim-population,nonmem2rx-qualify \
Rscript evals/eval.R
```

Logs go to `evals/logs/`, which is git-ignored. Browse them with `vitals::vitals_view("evals/logs")`; each sample shows the answer, the grader's explanation, and the code-execution result.

Running the `runs = TRUE` samples needs the nlmixr2 stack installed, plus callr. The skills condition sends about 140k characters of system prompt with every question, so its cost per sample is dominated by input tokens.

## Adding a sample

1. Write the question as a user would ask it.
2. Write the target from the skill content: the required elements, and the wrong answers that should fail.
3. Set `runs = TRUE` only if the answer must be runnable code, and keep that code fast. It runs once per sample, condition and epoch.
4. Run `Rscript -e 'testthat::test_local(filter = "evals")'`. It checks the dataset offline.

## Next steps

- **Grow the dataset.** Twelve questions establish the pipeline, not a measurement. Aim for at least 5–10 per skill, drawn from real user requests.
- **Evaluate the installed agent**, not just the content as a system prompt. `vitals::claude_code()` and `vitals::codex()` run the real agent CLIs in a Docker sandbox. Giving that sandbox an image with R, the nlmixr2 stack and the installed skills (`install_claude_code()`, `install_codex()`) would measure what users actually run, including the agent's tool use.
- **Track over time.** Run on each content change and compare per-sample scores against the previous run's logs.
