#' Install agents and skills as a project-root AGENTS.md
#'
#' Writes a single `AGENTS.md` at the project root in the format defined by
#' the cross-tool agents.md specification (`https://agents.md`). The file is
#' read by many tools that follow that convention, including OpenAI Codex
#' CLI, Cursor, Aider, GitHub Copilot, Zed, Warp, Jules, and Devin.
#'
#' For Codex-specific installation that also supports the user-level
#' `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` location and warns about the Codex byte cap, see
#' [install_codex()]. For Claude Code's separate skill/agent tree, see
#' [install_claude_code()].
#'
#' @param path Project root. Defaults to the current working directory.
#' @param packages Character vector of nlmixr2-universe packages to include.
#'   Defaults to all available packages.
#' @param mode How to handle an existing file: `"write"` (default),
#'   `"append"`, or `"error"`.
#' @param include Which content to include: `"both"` (default), `"agents"`,
#'   or `"skills"`.
#' @return Invisibly, the path written.
